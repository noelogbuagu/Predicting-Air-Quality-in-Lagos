#  Air Quality In Lagos

## Overview

This project examines air quality data from Victoria Island, Lagos. Then a time series model will be built to predict PM 2.5 readings throughout the day.

Focus Points:

1. Querying a MongoDB database.
2. Processing time series data for analysis.
3. Exploring time series data
4. Building an autoregression model.
5. Model improvement through hyperparameter tuning.
